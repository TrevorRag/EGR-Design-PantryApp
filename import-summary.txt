ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* LICENSE.txt
* README.md
* build.xml
* droidQuery.iml
* proguard-project.txt

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => droidQuery\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* libs\jCSS-Parser-0.0.2-sources.jar => droidQuery\libs\jCSS-Parser-0.0.2-sources.jar
* libs\nineoldandroids.jar => droidQuery\libs\nineoldandroids.jar
* lint.xml => droidQuery\lint.xml
* res\ => droidQuery\src\main\res\
* src\ => droidQuery\src\main\java\

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
